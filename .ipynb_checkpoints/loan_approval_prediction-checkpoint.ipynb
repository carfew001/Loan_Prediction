    "#### How the loan process works?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "According to the article in investopedia.com: \"When someone needs money, they apply for a loan from a bank, corporation, government, or other entity. The borrower may be required to provide specific details such as the reason for the loan, their financial history, Social Security number (SSN), and other information. The lender reviews this information as well as a person's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to determine if the loan can be paid back.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Based on the applicant's creditworthiness, the lender either denies or approves the application. The lender must provide a reason should the loan application be denied. If the application is approved, both parties sign a contract that outlines the details of the agreement. The lender advances the proceeds of the loan, after which the borrower must repay the amount including any additional charges, such as interest.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The terms of a loan are agreed to by each party before any money or property changes hands or is disbursed. If the lender requires collateral, the lender outlines this in the loan documents. Most loans also have provisions regarding the maximum amount of interest, in addition to other covenants, such as the length of time before repayment is required.\"\n",

    "The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.\n",

Vise Versa, the applicants who have the higher lower annual income have a wider range in the loan amounts. Besides that the lenders will only accept the loan amount that aligns with the annual income in order to insure the applicants have ability to pay the loan back, it is easy to imagine the applicants who have higher annual income have more flexibility on the amount of the loan, whatever for themselves or for the lenders.\n",

In this dataset, the applicants who has highest annual income has been approved when they apply for the highest loan amount (see the upper right corner of the figure), but at the same time, the applicants who have the highest annual income have chances of being rejected when they apply lower loan amount (see the middle right of the figure/lower right of the triangle). It can be caused by different lenders and other conditions of the applicants. Let's use some code to take a closer look at it."

Until the loan term equals to 8, both chances of being approved and rejected are tended to be normal. When the loan term reaches the 10 years, it is a loan term whose chance of being approved and rejected are approximately the same. After 10 years, the trend is becoming more consistent and the chance of being approved is slightly higher than the chance of being rejected.\n",
    "1. In the group of 2 years of loan term, the applicants who apply for loans for more than \\\\$30,000,000 have all been approved. Similar situation as the applicants in the group of the 4 years of loan term, who apply for more than \\\\$30,000,000 loan amount. Compared to the higher loan amount, the lower loan amount has more chance of being rejected, especially when the applicants want the 4 years of loan term. In my experience, short term loans with lower loan amounts should be even easier to be paid back, compared to larger amounts. What are the reasons that cause those applications to be rejected?

    "In our analysis, we found that `cibil_score` stands out as the most important factor influencing the model's predictions. One possible reason for this prominence could be that `cibil_score` has a notable relationship with the target variable `loan_status`. However, it's important to note that correlation doesn't imply causation. While `cibil_score` plays a crucial role in the model's predictions, it's important to remember that our model identifies patterns and associations in the data. The importance of a feature doesn't necessarily mean it directly causes the predicted outcomes.In the context of our problem, `cibil_score` corresponds to credit scores. We should also consider that other factors, interactions between features, and potential noise in the data can influence these findings. Therefore, a holistic understanding of the model's behavior requires taking these aspects into account. The insights from the feature importance analysis can guide us in making informed decisions and refining our strategies. It's important to interpret these findings alongside other domain knowledge and analysis."

    "In conclusion, this data analysis project aimed to explore the relationships between various variables in a dataset and the loan approval status. Through a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examined key features such as loan amount, annual income, loan term, asset values, and demographic factors.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. Our analysis revealed several important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Loan Amount and Annual Income: We found a strong positive correlation between loan amount and annual income. As expected, individuals with higher annual incomes were more likely to secure larger loan amounts. This underscores the importance of a borrower's financial capacity in determining loan approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Loan Term and Approval Rate: Shorter loan terms, particularly 2 and 4 years, exhibited higher approval rates compared to longer terms. This suggests that borrowers opting for shorter loan durations are perceived as lower risk by lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Asset Values and Income: Luxury asset values and bank asset values demonstrated stronger positive correlations with annual income compared to residential and commercial asset values. This suggests that higher-income individuals are more likely to possess luxury items and maintain larger bank assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Categorical Variables: Our ANOVA tests examined the relationships between categorical variables (no_of_dependents, education, self_employed) and loan amount. While some variables showed minor effects on loan amount, none exhibited statistically significant relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Machine Learning model: We used Random Forest model, which has ability to handle non-linearity, interactions between variables, and potential outliers, correctly predicted approximately 97% ~ 98% loan applications. This model allowed us to identify the most influential features in predicting loan approvals and made predictive performance remain reliable across various scenarios. While the model performs well, there's always room for improvement by gathering more data, refine features, and fine-tune model parameters to enhance predictive accuracy further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In light of these findings, it's clear that loan approval decisions are driven by a combination of financial factors, including income, loan amount, and loan term. While certain categorical variables appeared to have limited impact on loan amount, the overall focus should remain on financial indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's important to note that our analysis is subject to certain limitations. The dataset may not capture all relevant factors affecting loan approval, and outliers or data inaccuracies could influence results. Additionally, causation cannot be established through correlation alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Moving forward, this analysis provides valuable insights for lenders and borrowers alike. Lenders can use these findings to refine their loan approval criteria, while borrowers can better understand the factors influencing their chances of approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suggestion:\n",
    "    * Further research could delve deeper into qualitative aspects such as loan purpose, borrower credit history, and economic conditions. Additionally, considering a wider range of features and employing advanced machine learning techniques could provide a more nuanced understanding of loan approval dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this analysis sheds light on the intricate relationships between various factors and loan approval outcomes. The insights gained can guide data-driven decision-making in the lending industry."
